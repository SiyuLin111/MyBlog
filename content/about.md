I'm a chemistry-majored student from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). I'm gonna to carry on my master journey at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) with professor [Ding Ma & Meng Wang](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/mading/). My primary research interest lies within [heterogeneous catalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_catalysis). 

I've served as TA for General Chemistry (CHEM1103, Spectroscopy I (CHEM2231) and Introduction to Economics (ECON1001). You can find related tutorial notes at [Learning Resources](/learning-resources/). I've also posted some other lecture notes that I think might be useful there.
